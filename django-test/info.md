The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs.
You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns. admin.site.urls is the only exception to this.
The idea behind include() is to make it easy to plug-and-play URLs. 

The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name.
route : it is a string that contains a URL pattern. When processing a request, Django starts at the first pattern in urlpatterns and makes its way down the list, comparing the requested URL against each pattern until it finds one that matches.
view : When Django finds a matching pattern, it calls the specified view function with an HttpRequest object as the first argument and any “captured” values from the route as keyword arguments. We’ll give an example of this in a bit.
kwargs : Arbitrary keyword arguments can be passed in a dictionary to the target view. We aren’t going to use this feature of Django in the tutorial.
name : Naming your URL lets you refer to it unambiguously from elsewhere in Django, especially from within templates. This powerful feature allows you to make global changes to the URL patterns of your project while only touching a single file.
  
Patterns don’t search GET and POST parameters, or the domain name. 
For example, in a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/, the URLconf will look for myapp/. 
In a request to https://www.example.com/myapp/?page=3, the URLconf will also look for myapp/.
